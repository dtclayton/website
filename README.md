# What is VSec?
VSec is short for Viking Security and is a Danish InfoSec Community that are trying to "unify" the different local infosec groups in Denmark by providing a shared communication platform for each while still letting each crew handle their own sub-gruop channels.

VSec is meant to be a community for the community by the community, therefor all the local crew members has the possibility to be part of the community board channel and control how the community is run/handled (CoC, Guidelines, Rules, Events etc.).
