Over the last few years I have been giving various talks and lectures at different education houses around Denmark. I would now like to bring some of these subjects into VSec and run a series of lectures on a regular basis throughout 2021.

The series of lectures will be called “VSec presents… David and friends”, where I and some of my friends from around the cyber security community in Denmark will run workshops and lectures for around 1 or 2 hours every 2nd week in the evening after the kids have gone down.

The first few subjects will be focusing on the basic building blocks of Cyber Threat Intelligence with us slowly progressing into other areas, possibly Incident Response depending on what the feedback from the community is.

I hope you can find the time to join us for some of these sessions, I promise to make them fun and give you hands on experience within tools that can be used to enhance your daily work. Tools like Obsidian.md and various others!

We will make sure that the sessions are recorded in case you are unable to make it and then reshared via our VSec YouTube channel.

The sessions will start on August 5th and continue every 2nd week throughout 2021. With respect of family situation etc, the date may be subject to change but this will be mailed out with good notice!

Initial session plan:-

August 5th:- Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence

August 19th:- The importance of collecting your own data (Obsidian workshop)

September 2nd:- Incident Classification Taxonomies, how to record your own CTI

September 16th: Codifying your incidents using VERIS

September sessions will be announced towards the end of August.
